# GLSL Shaders by Billy Myles-Berkouwer
*A collection of pure GLSL shaders*

## How to run the shaders
These shaders can be executed using Patricio Gonzalez Vivo's [GLSLViewer library](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer). To display them through other means and on other platforms, the inputs need to be altered in the code. 

I will be adapting the best of these to accept JavaScript inputs so they can be displayed on the web using HTML Canvas. These will be accessible on [my shader portfolio website](https://webgl-shaders.netlify.app/).
