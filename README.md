# GLSL Shaders by Billy Myles-Berkouwer
*A collection of pure GLSL shaders*

## How to run the shaders
These shaders can be viewed by using Patricio Gonzalez Vivo's [GLSLViewer library](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer).

They are written in pure GLSL, using the inputs accessible to the shaders through this GLSLViewer library. Although GLSL is highly cross-platform, these shaders can only be displayed through Vivo's viewer. To be displayed through other methods, the inputs need to be altered in the code. I will be adapting the best of these to be run on the web using HTML Canvas. These will be accessible at [my website](https://webgl-shaders.netlify.app/).
